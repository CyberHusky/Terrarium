# Terrarium

This is the project that could help you to control watering flowers on OLED display. Point of project is code realization, that you could put your Arduino board in sleeping mode and awake it by pressing the button. I’ve used 10000mAh battery on Arduino UNO, that powered my project all week. If you use another board (Arduino nano or mini) it will powered project more long.

## Prerequisites
- Arduino UNO (or another arduino board);
- OLED display 0,96’’  I2C 128x64 (or another);
- 4 soil humidity sensor;
- 1 button.

## Scheme
Main scheme presented in fritzing file. 

## Testing
Tested on Arduino UNO on Arduino v1.6.
